#The Power of Possibility

#This program will show the power of possibility through examples. 

#Example 1
#The power of possibility enables us to think in new ways and explore previously unknown solutions. 

#Defining some initial variables
x = 0
y = 0

#Creating a loop to iterate over
for i in range(100):
	#Calculating a new value of x and y
	x = x + y
	y = y + 3
	#Printing out the current ratio of x to y
	print("x/y =", x/y)

#Example 2
#The power of possibility helps us to unlock potential in new areas of life. 

#Defining some initial variables 
n = 0
m = 0

#Creating a loop to iterate over 
for i in range(100): 
	#Calculating a new value of n and m 
	n = n + m
	m = m + 10
	#Printing out the current ratio of n to m 
	print("n/m =", n/m)

#Example 3
#The power of possibility helps us to create creativity where otherwise there was none.

#Defining some initial variables 
a = 0
b = 0

#Creating a loop to iterate over 
for i in range(100): 
	#Calculating a new value of a and b 
	a = a + b
	b = b + 5
	#Printing out the current ratio of a to b 
	print("a/b =", a/b)

#Example 4
#The power of possibility allows us to break through the boundaries of what is conventionally thought possible. 

#Defining some initial variables 
p = 0
q = 0

#Creating a loop to iterate over 
for i in range(100): 
	#Calculating a new value of p and q 
	p = p + q
	q = q + 2
	#Printing out the current ratio of p to q 
	print("p/q =", p/q)

#Conclusion
#The power of possibility is truly limitless. Through creative thinking, exploration, and the courage to break through boundaries, anything is possible.
